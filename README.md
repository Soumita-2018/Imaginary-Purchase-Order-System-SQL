## Features

- Relationships between items, customers, orders, and line items
- Execution of multiple SQL queries
- Display order date and approximate shipping date (3 days after order date)
- Comprehensive project report including ER diagram, constraints, keys, relationships, and metadata

## Technologies Used

- SQL
- Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)


## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ImaginaryPurchaseOrderSystem.git
    cd ImaginaryPurchaseOrderSystem
    

2. Ensure that an RDBMS (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) is installed and running on your machine.

3. Create the necessary database and run the SQL scripts in the sql directory in the following order:
    - create_tables.sql
    - insert_data.sql

## Usage

1. Open your preferred SQL client and connect to your database.

2. Execute the queries in the queries.sql file to interact with the purchase order system.

## SQL Queries

Some example SQL queries included in the project:

- Display order date and approximate shipping date (3 days after order date):

    sql
    SELECT order_id, order_date, order_date + INTERVAL 3 DAY AS approximate_shipping_date
    FROM orders;
    

- Other queries for retrieving and manipulating data related to items, customers, orders, and line items.

## ER Diagram

The ER Diagram including constraints, keys, relationships, and metadata is described in the project explanation PDF (Project_Report.pdf) located in the resources directory.
